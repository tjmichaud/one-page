# Single Page Template
========

## Purpose
A basic one page template to help students get a head start for those chosing to do a single page website for their final project.

This template will continue to be revised as needed but feel free to fork for additional one-page templates.

## CSS
The CSS is intentionally kept minimal for students to add in their own styles
- Normalize.css is added for a basic reset of the CSS

## HTML
The HTML can and should be modified to fit the needs of user.
- the top section uses a background image, but can easily be removed.
- the background image for the top section is for demonstrations on how to add a responsive backround image.

## jQuery
Version 1.10.2 is currently included.
